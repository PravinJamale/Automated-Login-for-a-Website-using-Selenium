A. Project Title: Automated-Login-for-a-Website-using-Selenium.py


B. Technology Stack:

   1. Programming Language: Python

   2. Libraries/Frameworks: Selenium


C. Benefits and Applications:

   1. Test Automation: The project can be utilized for automated testing scenarios to ensure the login functionality is working correctly.


D. Main Steps:

   a. Establishing Browser Connection:

      1. The project uses Selenium's webdriver to establish a connection with the Chrome browser.

      2. The browser window is maximized to ensure optimal visibility.

   b. Navigating to the Website:

      1. The code opens a target website (https://www.hackveda.in/one2one) for the login operation.

      2. A 2-second delay is introduced to allow the website to load properly.

   c. Entering Login Credentials:

      1. The project finds the username field on the webpage using its ID ("email").

      2. It enters the provided email address ("jamalepravin2001@gmail.com") into the username field.

      3. Another 2-second delay is introduced for synchronization.

   d. Entering Password:

      1. The project locates the password field on the webpage using its ID ("password").

      2. It enters the provided password ("63") into the password field.

      3. An additional 2-second delay is introduced for synchronization..

   e. Initiating Login:

      1. The project finds the login button on the webpage using its ID ("login_btn").

      2. A 5-second delay is introduced to ensure the page is fully loaded before clicking the button.

      3. The script clicks on the login button to initiate the login process.
